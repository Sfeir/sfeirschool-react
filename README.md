# SfeirSchool React

## Plan Exos

### Day 1

### Intro JSX, Elements, Components as functions, Props

Do not show advanced composition yet

- ex01 - HandsOn (JSX and props)
  only use function

### Local State and Simple Events

Events, Syntheticevents - just a callback (nothing special here)
Class Components, this binding, What's an element anyway
-> the class is just a representation
-> hooks FTW - a gentle introduction

### Lists, Conditional rendering, more about children

- ex04 - Conditional, Lists (show 'em all)
  -> carousel with arbitrary children

### Input / Refs
